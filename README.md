# ECG-signal-authentication-system
Creation of a biometric authentication system through ECG signals from different users with Matlab and Weka development.

A biometric authentication system has been created from the electrocardiogram signals of random users. To do this, a script has been created in Matlab capable of preprocessing, windowing and analyzing the characteristics extracted from the ECG signals.
