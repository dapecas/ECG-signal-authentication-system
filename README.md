# ECG-signal-authentication-system
Creation of a biometric authentication system through ECG signals from different users with Matlab and Weka development.

A biometric authentication system has been created from the electrocardiogram signals of random users. To do this, a script has been created in Matlab capable of preprocessing, windowing and analyzing the characteristics extracted from the ECG signals.
This project has been carried out to successfully complete the subject "Security in IoT" of the university master's degree Internet of Things: Applied Technologies of the Carlos III University of Madrid.
